                - Sensor readings show patterns associated with Parkinson's disease

                - Further clinical evaluation recommended
                
                **Next Steps:**
                1. Consult a movement disorder specialist
                2. Consider comprehensive neurological exam
                3. Monitor symptoms regularly
